I have implemented different clustering algorithms in Matlab in order to compare performance for different 2 dimensional data sets.

The 2 algorithms here are [k-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) and [expectation maximization.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm)

Here is a very brief summary of some of the results:

Dataset 1:

The first data set contains 2 gaussian distributions both with a SD = I but different means.

k-means results:

EM results:

We see that since we have SD = I for both distributions, both algorithms can cluster the data well.

Dataset 2:

The second dataset contains 3 gaussian distributions with different SD. Two of them have the same mean.

k-means results:

EM results:

In this case, k-means fails to identify the 2 different distributions with the same mean. k-means performs the best with spherical 
gaussian distributions. Meanwhile, EM can still perform well with more skewed SD. 

In general, both k-means and EM start to break down in performance when more dimensions are added.
